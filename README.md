Basic html webpage practice

While this is a very basic html page the main purpose of this project was essentially to practice git commands. It was really a learning experience on how to manage updates with git. I practiced writting git commit messages with the proper format and overall am much more comfortable with using git going forward. I will have to continue to refine my usage of the git commands as I move forward.
